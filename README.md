- **Editable Player Names:** Players can edit their names directly within the game interface and save them for a personalized gaming experience.
- **Winning Logic:** The game includes logic to detect when a player achieves a winning combination of symbols (three in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).
- **Draw Detection:** In case no player achieves a winning combination and the game board is full, the game recognizes it as a draw.
- **Rematch Button:** After the game ends (either by a win or draw), players have the option to initiate a rematch and restart the game.

## How to Play

1. **Player Names:** At the start of the game, players can edit their names by clicking on the player name section and saving the changes.
2. **Game Board:** The game board consists of a 3x3 grid where players can make their moves by clicking on the squares.
3. **Winning Condition:** The game detects winning combinations automatically. The player who achieves three symbols in a row, column, or diagonal wins.
4. **Draw Detection:** If all squares are filled without any player achieving a winning combination, the game results in a draw.
5. **Rematch:** After the game ends, players can click the "Rematch" button to start a new game with the same player names.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** The game is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **CSS:** Custom CSS styles are used for the game's visual presentation.
